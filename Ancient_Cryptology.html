	<h3>ancient cryptology</h3>
	
	<p>Cryptology in the ancient world consisted mostly of creating the codes rather than cracking them. This is due largely to the rudimentary technology 
		available at the time. Because of this, even though the codes created during this era were basic and unsecure by today's standards, they were formidible
		and nearly impossible to break during this time period. The first example of using a code to hide information was in Ancient Egypt, where a royal scribe 
		in the year 1900 BC used a mixture of symbolic markings and hieroglyphs to create an inscription on the wall of a tomb. This inscription, once deciphered, 
		told the story of Pharaoh Khnumhotep II, who was likely the scribe's master. Although this was not an attempt to hide secrets, it is nonetheless the 
		oldest example of an attempt by a human being to encrypt a message. </p>
		
	<p>As time moved forward, however, cryptography began to be used to hide both trade secrets and communications. In the lands of what was once Mesopotamia, a 
		cuneiform cipher from the year 1500 BC was revealed to hide a recipe for pottery glaze. Moving forward to the year 600 BC, Hebrew scholars created a 
		simple substitution cipher for their communications. Called the Atbash cipher, it divided the Hebrew alphabet in half before swapping letters with each other. 
		The first letter was equal to the last letter, the second letter equal to the penultimate letter, and so on and so forth. Two hundred years after that, 
		cryptology made its way into India in the form of the Mlecchita Vikalpa section of the Kama Sutra. Translated as "the art of writing in cipher", it 
		described ways for lovers to communication in secret using one of two substitution ciphers: Kautilyya and Muladeviya. Another cipher, called 
		Gudhayojya, added random or unnecessary letters to the beginning of each word. It was much simpler than the other ciphers, and thus less secure, 
		but was also easier to use in verbal communications. </p>
		
	<p>It was not until the age of the Greeks that cryptology truly began to take off. It was also during this time that enciphered messages began to see widespread
		use from the military. One of the main ciphers was that of the scytale transposition cipher. Used by the Spartan military, the system consisted of two identical
		wooden rods called scytales and a strip of cloth. The cloth would be wound around one of the scytals and a message would be written down. The writer then unwrapped 
		the fabric and filled in the blank spaces with other numbers. This created what appeared to be a string of random letters. A messenger would then transport the
		message to a different legion's commander, who would then wrap the cloth around his own scytale to reveal the message. Although simple in nature, this form of 
		communication was relatively safe and effective for the time. For starters, the messages were able to be easily transported secretly due to it being written on
		a small strip of fabric rather than on a scroll as an official document. If a messenger was intercepted, they could simply scrunch the fabric up and hide it in a small 
		crack or in the palm of their hand. Secondly, even if the message fell into enemy hands, they would need a scytale of the same length and thickness as the one the code 
		had been written on in order to decipher it. Another invention of the Greeks was the Polybius square. Although it was more of a telegraphic tool that modeled 
		cryptographic principles than an actual code, it nonetheless was an important development. It consisted of a square grid with five rows and columns, with each 
		square on the grid representing a letter of the alphabet. Using the modern-day English alphabet as an example, the letter A would be equivalent to square 1, 
		while the letter P would be equivalent to square 16. This encoding system was used to transport messages via torch signals. At night, the torches could be raised and 
		lowered to signify which grid square the signaller was representing. This allowed for fire signals to be used to transport messages across long distances without the need 
		to pre-arrange meanings for them. </p>
	
	<p>As Greece fell and Rome moved to become the dominant power in Europe, codes continued to develop. More complex substitution ciphers began to appear; 
		the most famous of which being the Caesar Cipher. Much like the scytale cipher of Sparta, this code was used to transport messages between Julius 
		Caesar and his military generals. Unlike the scytale cipher, however, the Caesar cipher did not require a physical object to decode the messages. 
		Instead, it made use of an alternative alphabet created by shifting the letters of the Latin alphabet over a set number of places. The traditional Caesar 
		cipher used a shift of +3, but any number between one and twenty-six could be used. Once the alternative alphabet was created, a message would be written using
		it and sent out to a legion. Upon its arrival, the general would then reverse the shift to decode the message. Although it was quite simple, this cipher was 
		secure enough that it took approximately eight hundred years for it to be cracked. This is due in large parts to the fact that many of the emperor's enemies were
		illeterate. The lack of code-breaking knowledge and techniques also helped it remain secure for several centuries.
