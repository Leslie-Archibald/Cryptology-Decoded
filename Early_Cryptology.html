	<h3>arab cryptology</h3>

	<p>When Europe fell into the Medival Era, the progression of cryptology stalled to a halt. In the Middle East, however, this same study flourished.
		It was here where true cryptanalysis would finally be born. The first well-known scholar to contribute to this field of study was Al-Khalil ibn 
		Ahmad al-Farahidi. He was a linguist teacher by trade, but also was the author of many books. One such book, entitled "Book of Cryptographic Messages",
		was the first book devoted to the study of cryptology by a person in his field. The work is now lost, but included many important concepts. This included 
		the use of permutations and combinations to create a list of all possible Arabic words. The book was, in many ways, the authoritative work on cryptology 
		for other Arab schoalrs. They would refer to his analysis for calculating letter frequency in their own work.</p>
		
	<p>One of the scholars that came after Al-Khalil was Al-Kindi. He was, among many things, a polymath and mathematician. Building off of Al-Khalil's work, 
		he developed a concept known as frequency analysis. This was used to crack monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. First, a cryptanalyst counts the 
		occurance of letters in a language, noting which ones are used the most. This useage is unique fingerprint of the language that is preserved even 
		in the substituted messages. By counting the frequency of letters in the ciphertext, the code breaker finds the fingerprint of the alphabet used 
		in the cipher. By comparing the fingerprint of the original language and thefingerprint of the cipher alphabet, the cryptanalyst is able to figure 
		out the shift used and decipher the message.</p> 
		
	<p>Frequency analysis grew to encompass not just the counting of letters, but also letter pairings such as 'th' and repeated letters such as 'ss'. Also noted
		were letters and letter combinations that frequently started and ended words. This further aided the deciphering of encoded messages. By the year 800 AD, 
		Al-Kindi had taken his knowledge and written a book titled "A Manuscript on Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence" that contained his work on frequency
		analysis. This became the first use of statistics to crack a code. It rendered the previously secure monoalphabetic substitution ciphers readable and 
		cemeneted Al-Kindi's position as one of the fathers of cryptanalysis. Later Arab Scholars would build off of his work to study the importance of alphabet 
		size in ciphers. They also would develop more complex transposition ciphers, as well as some of the first polyalphabetic ciphers. For these reasons, the birth
		of cryptanalysis in the Arab world would remain the most significant event in the history of cryptology until the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
		
	<h3>early european cryptology</h3>
	
	<p>Aside from the Arab world, cryptology stalled in the West during the Middle Ages. Once the fifteenth century hit, however, Europe entered the Renaissance 
		period. Art, music, theology, and philosophy began to blossom - and so did codes. One of the most well-known and secure ciphers to come out of this era
		was the Alberti cipher. Created by an architech named Leon Alberti by request of the Pope's staff, it is considrered by many to be the first polyalphabetic
		cipher developed in Europe. The Alberti cipher was a substitution cipher, but improved upon the faults of the monoalphabetic ciphers by using multiple alphabets. 
		These alphabets were periodically changed throught the encoding process, meaning that one letter could be represented by many different letters in the same
		message. Using the Caesar cipher, A would simply be replaced by a single letter such as D. Using the Alberti cipher, however, A could not only be represented by
		D, but also by J and T. The changing of the alphabet masked a language's letter distribution. This rendered frequency analysis ineffective. As this was the main
		cryptanalysis technique at the time, messages encryped in this cipher were considred to be practically unbreakable.</p>
		
	<p>One of the bigger problems with the Alberti cipher, however, was keeping track of the alphabets used and the order they were used in. It was a complicated affair, 
		and one small lapse in memory could cause the ciphertext to become unreadable. Alberti solved this by making his second contribution to the world of cryptology: 
		a mechanical device that could be used to aid in the encryption and decryption of messages. Called Alberti's Disk, the device featured two concentric rings attached
		to each other in such a way as to allow them to rotate. These rings were divided into 24 segments and housed two alphabets. The alphabet on the outer ring was 
		in proper order, while the one on the inner ring was scrambled. A marker was used to select a starting index letter on the inner ring, which could be matched up
		to any letter in the outer ring. After that, a message would be encrypted by translating it into the inner alphabet. Every so often a new index letter would be 
		selected. This further scrambled the frequency that letters appeared. Some models also included the numbers one through four on the outer ring. These models were 
		used in conjunction with a codebook of phrases that had a pre-assigned numerical value. Using this allowed a writer to extend the length of messages that could be 
		sent without drastically increasing the length of the ciphertext. The numbers, once encrypted, were also indistinguishable from words, making it impossible to tell
		at a glance if the codebook was used or not. </p>
		
	<p>As the Renaissance continued to progress forward, Alberti's cipher remained the strongest code available. Hauling around the disc used to encrypt and decrypt 
		messages, however, could also be troublesome. The method of encoding the index letter within the ciphertext to indicate the swaps between various alphabets also made
		it harder to use. It would not take long for a similar cipher to be created that attempted to solve these flaws. The first person to aid in the creation of this cipher 
		was a German monk named Johannes Trithemius. He authored a book titled "Polygraphiae", which is believed to be the first published work focusing solely on cryptology. 
		Within its pages, it outlined something now called a tabula recta. This table consisted of interwoven cipher alphabets, each one transposed one space over from the 
		previous one using a simple substitution cipher. It was strong, and as the table could be quickly recreated anywhere by anyone there was no need to carry a disk around 
		to solve it. Unfortunately, however, the system used to swap from one alphabet to the next was much more predictable than the random Alberti cipher.</p>
		
	<p>Shortly after the development of the tabula recta, two men -  Giovan Bellaso of Italy and Blaise de Vigenere of France - began to work on extending the 
		use of this cipher table. Bellaso was the first, presenting his idea in 1553; while Vigenere would not propose his own cipher until the year 1586. The 
		two ciphers proposed were extremely similar, to the point where Bellaso’s work would be credited to Vigener. The indecipherable cipher, as it would 
		come to be known, pulled its key from the message being encrypted rather than being arbitrarily decided. After this key is determined, each letter’s 
		position in the standard alphabet is calculated. ‘A’ is equal to 1, ‘B’ is equal to 2, and so on and so forth. This numerical value is used as the 
		shift for the first letter of the plaintext. After that, the cipher alphabet is changed, and the numerical value of the second letter in the keyword 
		becomes the new shift value. Upon using the last letter of the key, the writer jumps to the first letter and continues the encryption. The constant 
		changing of the shift value and the cipher alphabet in use is primarily what made Vigenere’s cipher so strong. This masked the letter distribution, 
		making frequency analysis an inefficient method of cracking the code. The longer the key that is used, the more secure this cipher becomes. The cipher was 
		so strong that it would not be broken until the year 1854 by English mathematician Charles Babbage.</p>

	<p> The Vigenere and Alberti ciphers would be the most secure codes developed in the Renaissance and early Enlightenment periods.  Others would be 
		created and employed by royalty and the Vatican, but they lacked the complexity necessary to be truly secure. This allowed cryptanalysts to easily 
		crack them, sometimes to dramatic effect. One such case was that of the Babington Plot. A sordid tale of betrayal, double agents, and one of the 
		earliest known cases of a man-in-the-middle attack; the ultimate goal of this plot was to overthrow the protestant Queen Elizabeth I and install her 
		Roman Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne of England. To facilitate this and ensure that the imprisoned Mary was aware of the plot, 
		she would communicate with the conspirators with encrypted letters. The cipher used was called a nomenclator cipher - a substitution cipher that 
		replaced common words with symbols and shorthand. Unbeknownst to either side, however, was the fact that their messages were being intercepted. 
		Gilbert Gifford, the chosen messenger, delivered the letters first to a cryptographer named Thomas Phelippes who worked for Elizabeth’s court. 
		Phelippes would copy the letters for decryption before returning them to Gifford who would then take them to their intended recipients. After 
		cracking the code he began to amass evidence, and in one case altered Mary’s letter slightly to ask for the names of the conspirators. Elizabeth 
		was aware of the plan to take her life, and after seven months stepped in and put an end to it. The conspirators were hung before being drawn and 
		quartered. Mary’s letters were used as evidence against her in a trial, and she was summarily beheaded.</p>
		
	<p> A similar cipher, known as “Grand Chiffre” or Great Cipher, was used in the French courts at this time. It too was a nomenclator cipher, 
		though unlike Mary’s it encrypted syllables as well as words. Developed by the father and son duo of  Antoine and Bonaventure Rossignol, the resulting 
		cipher was incredibly strong. At least five hundred and eighty-seven numerical values were used to represent words, letters, and syllables in a message. 
		The Rossignols’ also included some blank numbers that corresponded to nothing for the purpose of throwing off frequency analysis. The Grand Chiffre was 
		so strong that it would not be cracked until the 1890s by a French military cryptanalyst named Etienne Bazeries.</p>
