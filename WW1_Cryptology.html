	<h3>wwi century cryptology</h3>

	<p>As the 20<sup>th</sup> century began, changes in technology were about to help cryptology take drastic leaps forward. Guglielmo Marconi's invention
		of the radio in the late 1890s revolutionized communications by allowing messages to be sent over long distances without being hampered by natural 
		boundaries. In the world of cryptology, however, this was a double-edged sword. Radio communications, although quick and efficient, could easily be 
		intercepted by enemies. Furthermore, the conventional code used to transport messages over radio and telegraph was not secure. Morse code, which had 
		been invented in the mid-1840s, was public. It would be easy for anyone who intercepted the messages to decode them. To ensure that transmissions were 
		secure, the messages had to be encoded before being translated into Morse code and sent out. The need for new ciphers would only become clearer with 
		the start of World War I. This war was arguably the first that had an inforation front; a war of secret communications with all sides scrambling to 
		gain as much intelligence on the enemy as possible. Those that had the stronger ciphers and smarter codebreakers were the ones ho had an edge, and 
		perhaps no one these two things more than the British. </p>
		
	<p>The British Admiralty's codebreaking division, known as Room 40, brought together some of the brightest minds in the country. Their job was to intercept and
		crack the codes of the Central Powers. Perhaps its most notable achievement during this time was the cracking of German naval codes. In 1914, near the 
		beginning of the war, Russian troops managed to capture a German naval cruiser in the Baltic Sea. Among the items on the ship was a book containing the 
		main naval codes used by Germany. Russia sent the book to Engald where it was given to the men in Room 40. Using the book the men of the codebreaking division 
		were able to decipher communications between the German ships and their home bases. These communications relayed, among other things, information about German 
		naval positions and their plans for future attacks. Using this knowledge, Englad was able to responde appropriately and trap the ships with their superior navy.</p>
		
	<p>Cryptology would also play a role on the eastern front between Germany and Russia. This time, however, it would be the Germans who were able to use intercepted 
		messages to turn the tides of battle. Early twentieth-century Russian ciphers were weak and rudimentary. The Germans quickly broke them, and although a new one 
		was developed not all of the commanding officers had the corresponding codebook. Thus when Russia's First and Second Armies commnunicated with each other, they 
		were forced to either use the old cipher or send unencrypted messages in the vain hope that they wouldn't be intercepted. Germany, however, was able to read 
		these communications with ease. Russia's plan was simple. The two armies would split up and go into East Prussia before launching a pincer attack on the German 
		eastern forces. In principle, it was a good idea. Had the Germans not been able to glean as much information as they did from the intercepted communications, it 
		may have even been successful. The Germans, however, knew that the southern army was moving faster than the northern army. Sensing an opportunity, the Germans
		moved a large chunk of their forces to meet the southern army and destroyed them in the Battle of Tannenberg. It would be the first major defeat the Russians
		experienced, and was a major contribution towards their eventual descent into civil war.</p>
		
	<p>	The bottlenecking of the German navy and the Battle of Tannenberg both demonstrated the importance of having strong, secure ciphers and just how much power information 
		could give to one side. These two examples, however, would pale in comparison to the event that would draw the United States into the war: the deciphering of the Zimmermann 
		Telegram. The note, written by Artur Zimmermann in January of 1917, was destined for the German ambassador to Mexico. Germany planned on restarting unrestricted submarine 
		warfare the following month, despite knowing that it would most likely cause the United States to join the growing war. If that were to happen, he laid out a proposal for 
		Mexico to enter into the war and fight their northern neighbor. In return, Germany would help finance the Mexicans and ensure that they would regain a large chunk of their 
		former territory in what is now Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona during peace negotiations. The telegram was encrypted in a new cipher known only as Diplomatic Code 0075 and 
		sent on its way. The telegram's planned journey was for it to start in Berlin and go to the American embassy in Denmark. This stop was only part of the process due to the 
		fact that British divers had cut the German international communication cables. Thus the warring nation had to rely on the cables of neutral countries for international 
		diplomatic communications.  After being transferred to the American cables the signal traveled to a power station on the British coastline where it would receive a quick 
		boost of energy for the transatlantic jump. It would arrive at the German embassy in Washington DC, and the ambassador there would forward it to Mexico. Unbeknownst to 
		either the Germans or the Americans, however, was that all traffic that got routed through the power station was copied and sent to Room 40. Upon realizing that the 
		telegram was in a new, unknown cipher system the cryptanalysts began to study it. The 0075 code was among one of the most complex in existence at the time. Over ten 
		thousand words and phrases were attached to thousands of numerical code groups. It was described by many as mind-numbing, and though the men in Room 40 were able to get 
		a few words deciphered, the large body of the telegram resisted most attempts to break it. </p>
	
	<p>	While the British were working with their copy of the telegram, the original one found its way to the German embassy in Washington DC. The ambassador in charge there, Johann von
		Bernstorff, unencrypted it before encrypting it in an older cipher. It was a matter of policy. Although the Americans let the Germans use their undersea telegram lines, they 
		would only transmit the message as far as the embassy; the ambassador there would have to arrange for any further transmissions from there. The solution was often to use a commercial 
		telegraph service such as Western Union, but the coded message created a small problem. Any use of high-level codes on commercial networks was explicitly forbidden in an attempt 
		to keep them secure. It was this very policy that would cause the Zimmerman Telegram to be deciphered. British Agents intercepted the telegram again in Mexico City, this time 
		through a contact at the telegraph office. A copy of the telegram in the simpler cipher was obtained and sent to Room 40. Due to its similarities between previously cracked 
		diplomatic and naval codes, the telegram was easily deciphered. It revealed not only the German plans but provided cleartext that could be used to start cracking the new 0075 code. 
		British codebreakers would accomplish this feat a few months later, adding to the growing number of cracked German codes. The British would not reveal the fact that they had tapped 
		American communication lines several decades after the war. They would instead turn over the copy obtained in Mexico City. Predictably the United States was outraged. Public opinion 
		in support of entering the war jumped sharply, and soon the country had joined the fighting. Codes would continue to play a key part in the war on all sides, primarily for communication 
		between units in the trenches and at sea. Although the events surrounding the constant interception and cracking of the trench codes were not nearly as dramatic as that of the Zimmerman 
		telegram, they nonetheless represented a new and vital component of warfare that continued into the future. </p>
		
	<p>World War I would end in 1918, but the development of cryptology would not stop there. Electrical coding machines started to be developed around the end of the war, first in the United 
		States and then in Germany. These machines featured a keyboard connected to one or many electric rotors and, in some cases, a small display board featuring the letters. The rotors would 
		be randomly wired together, with the previous one connecting to the display board. Pressing a key would send an electric signal up through the rotors, where it was scrambled and directed 
		back into the display board where the corresponding encrypted letter would be illuminated. For the first time in its almost three-thousand-year-old history, the process of encrypting a 
		message could be fully mechanized. The German machine, invented by an engineer named Arthur Scherbius, would soon start to be mass-produced and sold to militaries and governments of various 
		countries under the brand name Enigma. For most of the 1920s ciphers were used to protect diplomatic transmissions or messages between smugglers. National cipher bureaus sprang up in countries 
		that didn’t have dedicated organizations, such as the United States. Their Cipher Bureau, headed by Herbert Yardley, would be the nation’s first peacetime government organization dedicated 
		to cryptology. It posed as a company in New York City that sold codes, but in truth, it was trying to decrypt diplomatic communications between various countries and their embassies. The 
		information gained from this covert spying was useful not just in terms of seeing whether or not a war was about to break out, but also at the negotiation table. The best example of Yardley’s 
		success on this front came in 1921 at the Washington Naval Conference. Called by then-president Woodrow Willson, its goal was to attempt to limit the maximum strength of naval powers in the 
		Pacific Ocean. One of the main countries that had a large stake in this area was Japan. </p>

	<p> Japan’s ciphers were difficult to decode due largely in part to the fact that the Japanese language is complex. Only adding to the difficulty was the code currently in use was changed 
		frequently - by some counts a dozen were used between 1919 and early 1920. Despite these factors, they were not unbreakable. Yardley’s team was able to break it and were soon sending 
		the decrypted communications between Japan and its representatives to the United States’ negotiation team. Upon realizing that the Japanese were planning to accept much less than what 
		they were asking for, the United States was able to negotiate a treaty with their key interests in mind. Japan was backed into accepting this, a major victory for both the United States 
		and its Cipher Bureau. As much as enciphered communication was powerful, however, it had a flaw that could not be engineered out. Broken codes are only a useful tool if the secrets of their 
		interception and decoding are kept secret. Many major world powers would soon learn this lesson. The first was Great Britain, and was triggered by Winston Churchill in 1925 upon the publishing 
		of his book "The World Crisis". This account of World War I revealed that the English had broken German naval codes with a stolen codebook. Germany quickly realized that this was no longer a 
		secure way to communicate if all it took was one ship being captured to render the encryption useless. They instantly began to search for a stronger cipher method, which eventually lead them to
		Scherbius' Enigma cipher systems. </p>

	<p>Across the pond, the United States also was in the midst of learning the same lesson as Britain thanks to a tell-all  book by a disgruntled ex-government employee.
		Despite the Cipher Bureau’s success at the Washington Naval Conference, half of its funding was cut merely three years later. The rest of it would be taken away in 1929 by then-Secretary of 
		State Henry Stimson. Some argue that it was a moralistic decision, citing the fact that not all of the intercepted communication came from hostile powers - a large number came from close allies. 
		They also point to a quip he reportedly said while making the decision: “Gentlemen don’t read other gentlemen’s’ mail.” To others, it was merely a budget decision to eliminate a government organization 
		not quite seen as necessary in a year where the economy began to worsen. Regardless of the case, the Cipher Bureau was shuttered.  Out of work, in need of money, and perhaps upset at the perceived 
		moralistic high ground of Stimson, Yardley began to work on a book about his experiences. The American Black Chamber,  as it would be titled, was equal parts sensational and scandalous. Among other 
		things, it told of how they had broken Japan’s diplomatic codes. Much like how Germany responded to Churchill’s book by moving towards the more tightly secured machine ciphers, Japan did the same in 
		response to Yardley’s. By the time World War II broke out, both countries had developed extremely strong mechanized cipher systems, which would take years and a considerable effort to crack.</p>
