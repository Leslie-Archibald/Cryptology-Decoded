	<p>America's focus during World War Two was breaking the codes of the Japanese. A team led by William F. Friedman focused first on the two cipher 
		machines used by their foreign office, named “Type A Cipher Machine” and “Type B Cipher Machine” respectively. The United States codenamed them Red and Purple. 
		Red enciphered consonants and vowels separately to create a series of syllables that could be pronounced. This was done primarily for a financial reason. 
		Telegraph regulations stated that telegrams with pronounceable words would cost less than unpronounceable code groups. The separate encryptions ensured that 
		the produced ciphertext would be able to be read aloud, but it was also what made Red unsecured. It was quickly broken but remained in use until 1938 with 
		the introduction of Purple. The Purple code was more complex than Red, and frustrated American attempts to solve it. The slow rollout of the machine was 
		ultimately what would doom it. With few Purple machines in existence, only the highest priority posts obtained them at first. Those of lesser importance 
		would continue to use Red. Due to this reason, there were many cases of a message being sent in both Red and Purple. Americans would quickly intercept these. 
		They were able to decipher the ones in Red, providing a plaintext crib that could be used to work out the Purple cipher’s workings. A year and a half passed 
		before Friedman’s team was able to accomplish it. One member, Leo Rosen, was able to create a decrypting machine for the code to automate the process. 
		With diplomatic communications no longer secure, information began pouring in. One of the best sources was the Japanese ambassador to Germany, a man by the 
		name of Hiroshi Oshima. He was a confidant of Hitler and was privy to some of the inner workings and secrets of the Nazi party. In 1943 he went on a tour of 
		the front lines in France. Upon returning to Berlin, he transmitted an incredibly detailed description of what he had seen back to Tokyo using the Purple code. 
		Unbeknownst to either side, however, was that the Americans had intercepted this message and deciphered it. Together, the information gained from the cracked Enigma, 
		Lorenz, and Purple codes would be invaluable in the planning of D-Day, which would mark the beginning of the end for the war in Europe.</p>

	<p>The cracking of codes continued to be important in the Pacific theatre. Aside from their work on Purple, Friedman’s team had also been working on breaking various 
		Japanese naval codes. Their slow progress had cost them dearly in December of 1941, where they possibly could have had a warning about the impending strike on Pearl 
		Harbor. Like with Purple, cribs were used to help decipher the naval codes by preying upon the extreme importance decorum held in Japanese culture. There were several common 
		formalities regularly used in repeated messages, which could be used to start working out the characteristics of the code. It would be broken in March of 1942. Four months 
		later it would play a critical role in the Battle of Midway. In May of 1942, a Japanese message was decrypted that spoke of a huge attack force heading for a target designated 
		only as ‘AF’. Codebreakers in Hawaii believed this target to be in the central Pacific, specifically the Midway Atoll. They managed to convince the admiral of the Pacific Fleet, 
		Chester Nimitz, of this but their superiors in Washington were less convinced. They believed AF to be the Aleutian Islands. What followed was a genius deceptive plot. Led by 
		their commanding officer Joseph Rochefort, the codebreakers instructed the forces stationed at Midway to make an emergency broadcast. They were to say that their water desalination 
		system had broken and that they only had enough water for about two weeks. The message was sent both in the clear and in an old cipher that the United States was aware that Japan 
		had cracked. Midway was to follow this up with another report a week later. The trap had been set, and Japan took the bait. Several days later a Japanese message was intercepted. 
		Upon decryption, it revealed an order to bring additional desalination equipment in preparation for the attack, as AF was running low on water. The message also revealed the time 
		of the attack, which would be in early June. The Pacific Fleet was dispatched and surprised the Japanese with their own attack. Heavy losses forced the Japanese to retreat back 
		to their home base to take care of the wounded, repair the unsunk ships, and start to train new sailors to replace those who had died. Despite this, they would never fully recover.</p>
