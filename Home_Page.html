	<p>Welcome to Cryptology: Decoded. This website aims to try and provide a brief explanation of cryptology's rich and varied history. From the more 
		well-known cases of the Enigma machine and the lesser known work of the Arab scholars in the field of cryptanalysis, I hope to help others learn 
		about this amazing field of study. When I first started to study this particular aspect of the field, I was disappointed in how there were not a 
		lot of websites dedicated solely to the subject of cryptological history. What websites there were focused only on a small part, such as the 
		Enigma machine or the cryptology of the Renaissance. I decided to create my own website as a brief catch-all of the history of cryptology in the 
		hopes that it will facillitate learning about this field.</p>
	
	<p>Cryptology is subdivided into two parts: cryptography and cryptanalysis. Cryptographers are the code makers, while cryptanalysis are the code 
		makers. In ancient times the code makers were the ones who held the most power int his field, and even with the beginnings of cryptanalysis in 
		the 13th century they remained at the top. It was not until the 20th century, specifically during the two World Wars, where cryptanalysts began
		their rise to the top. Together they have played an important role in the military, diplomatic relations, the public sector, and the private sector. 
		In an age where things like online shopping, banking, and other forms of e-commerce are commonplace, security has never been more important. 
		Thanks to the work of many cryptologists we continue to develop newer, safer, more secure encrypting methods to keep this online business ecosystem
		afloat. We use it in many things - emails, monetary transactions, login information - but oftentimes aren't aware of just how important it is. </p>
