	<h2>cryptology in the computer age</h2>
	
	<h3>at a glance</h3>
	<p>As the world prorgressed into the age of computers, the rapid advancement of technology enabled encoding methods to become much stronger extremely 
		quickly. At first these developments, such as the Data Encryption Standard or DES, were only available to the government. In the 1970s, however,
		computers became more readily available to civillians and businesses. This, combined with the need for secure communications in both the public and
		private sectors, caused cryptology to become extremely widespread. Further developments, such as the asymmetric key cryptography model, RSA, and PGP 
		contined to fuel the rise of cryptology in non-military settings.</p>

	<p>As World War Two came to an end, a new era dawned. The government, having learned valuable lessons after the blunders commited by multiple people
		after the previous World War, closely guarded its decryption secrets. Winston Churchill would write a book about the events of World War II, 
		but left out the extensive cryptanalysis and breaktrhough that had occurred in Britain. There was no mention of Bletchley Park's work on the 
		Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. In the United States, the wartime cryptanalysis division was retained, first in the form of the Armed Forces Security 
		Agency, or AFSA, and then as the National Security Agency, or NSA. William Friedman, the man who had led the efforts ot break the Purple system, 
		would become its chief cryptologist. He would go on to author a series of textbooks used to train NSA students, before quietly retiring alongside his 
		wife and fellow cryptanalyst Elizabeth. The Navajo codetalkers were sworn to secrecy and continued to play an active part in US military conflicts through 
		the first half of the Vietnam War. In 1968 materials about them were finally declassified, allowing for the codetalkers' contributions to the war 
		effort to finally be realized.</p>

		
	<p>Cryptology continued to be developed, with codes becoming more and more secure. As a general rule of thumb, if a code maker doubles the possible number
		of code combinations, used, the code breaker has to square the number of combinations they potentially have to try to find the exact key for solving the
		cipher. The longer the key, the stronger the encryption was. IBM developed one of these newer, more secure encoding methods in the early 1970s. Known as 
		the Data Encryption Standard, or DES, it used a key length of one hundred and twenthy-eight bits. Even though this number was later cut in half to fifty-six
		bits, the US Government quickly adopted DES and used it to encrypt their non-classified documents.</p>
		
	<p>The 1970s would also bring about one of cryptology's greatest leaps. Up until this point in history, cryptology was almost exclusively used by governments
		and their militaries. With computers becoming more readily available, however, more and more businesses in the public and private sectors began recognize
		their need for increased security on the . The development of DES only furthered this, and soon businesses were looking into ways of encrypting their 
		communications. Despite all these advancements, though, there was still one overarching problem with encrypted communications: key transportation. Up until 
		this point in history all ciphers used symmetric cryptographic algorithms. The key that is used to encrypt a document is the same as the one used to decrypt 
		the document. Distribution and maintenance of secure keys used by multiple people over a large geographic area was quite difficult. This was emphasized by the 
		prolific thift of keys uring the leadup to the cracking of Enigma during World War II.</p>
	
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/Leslie%20Archibald/Desktop/Cryptography_Website/Images/RSA_Inventors.jpg" alt="A photograph of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard 
		Alderman, the inventors of RSA" style="float: left; margin: 30px;">
	
	<p>A solution to the problem of symmetric key cryptography was proposed in the mid 1970s by a trio of Stanford cryptographers named Whitfield Diffie, Ralph Murgle, 
		and Martin Helman. Together, they created a theoretical model of encrypting messages without the need for a private key. This would become the basis of asymmetric 
		key cryptography. Whereas symmetric key cryptography required matching private keys to be used, asymmetric key cryptography made use of two different keys: a public one 
		available to everyone, and a private one available to the user. If someone wanted to send a secure message to a friend, they would encrypt that message using that 
		friend's public key before sending it. Upon its arrival, the friend would then use their private key to decrypt it. The process could also be reversed, with the 
		message being encrypted with the private key and decrypted with the corresponding public key.</p>
		
	<p>At its conception, asymmetric key cryptography was merely a theoretical model. It would not be until 1977 where Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman would 
		create an algorithm that made use of the concept. Called RSA, it would go on to become one of the most commonly used asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. It worked 
		by using large prime numbers to compute a public and private key. This, however, also made it slower than contemporary symmetric key algorithms. DES was one hundred 
		times faster in software than RSA, and anywhere from one thousand to ten thousand times faster in hardware. Nonetheless, RSA’s development was a huge step forward 
		in making encrypted communications available to the general public. Five years later in 1982, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman would start a company named RSA Data Security. 
		It would be the first commercial business to offer asymmetric key cryptography to the general public. This enabled the rise of secure e-commerce on the Internet, 
		something that would later explode with the conception of the World Wide Web.</p>
		
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/Leslie%20Archibald/Desktop/Cryptography_Website/Images/Phillip_Zimmerman.jpg" alt="A photograph of Phillip Zimmerman, the inventor of Pretty Good Privacy">
	
	<p>Encryption becoming available to everyone, however, was not viewed as something to celebrate by the government. Asymmetric cryptography was beginning to counterbalance the 
		government monopoly on secure communications. This was something that the NSA was desperate to stop. They tried several ways to slow the spread of RSA. In 1986, they would 
		prevent Lotus Development from exporting the software they had created, purely due to the fact that it made use of RSA encryption. The agency would also go after a man named Phil 
		Zimmermann in 1993. Zimmermann had created an encryption program he called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, two years earlier. PGP used asymmetric cryptography over the Internet. 
		More importantly, it was compatible on any computer, and not just the large ones owned by the government and corporations. It was available to the masses, and provided them 
		access to some of the most powerful encryption algorithms available at the time. The NSA was both terrified and incensed. PGP, they believed, was severely hindering their 
		ability to gather intelligence and break codes used by terrorists and criminals. When PGP made its way outside of the United States the NSA would begin investigating Zimmerman 
		for exporting munitions - in this case, the cryptographic algorithm - without a license. Zimmermann responded by publishing the source code of PGP in a book that people 
		could use to create their own copies of the program. The premise was simple - regulations existed for exporting data software, but no such regulations existed on books 
		about data software since books were protected speech under the First Amendment. This line of thought would never be officially tested in court in relation to PGP, but it 
		was remarkably sound. It would later become an established precedent in appeals for Bernstein v. United States and Junger v. Daley. Zimmermann’s investigation would be 
		dropped in 1996, with no charges filed.</p>

	<p>By 1994, RSA encryption was in almost everything, and it was still going strong. The NSA, realizing that it wouldn’t be able to stop the spread of public key cryptography, 
		sought a compromise instead. They proposed the installation of what they called the Clipper chip in communications devices. It functioned as a backdoor to bypass the 
		encryption, allowing the government access to the device. Similar to a wiretap, the chip could only be accessed with a court order. The NSA rigorously promoted it as a way 
		to allow them to monitor criminal communications while still allowing citizens a measure of privacy. The public pushed back, concerned about illegal surveillance and a loss 
		of privacy. There was also the worry about the Clipper chips, which started out with voluntary installations, would quickly become mandatory in all devices. Companies such as RSA 
		Security campaigned against it, promoting ideas such as the right to encryption and exportation of encryption software. Several politicians, such as Senators John Ashecroft and 
		John Kerry, staunchly opposed the idea. With too much backlash, the NSA were forced to abandon the idea.<p>
	
	<p>Cryptology has continued to play a big role into the twenty-first century. Elliptic Curve Cryptography, first proposed in the 1980s, continues to be used in mobile devices due to 
		not needing as much computing power as other algorithms. Its strength is comparable to that of RSA. DES would eventually be replaced with Tripled Data Encryption Standard, or 3DES, 
		due to security vulnerabilities. RSA continues to be used, but it is gradually fading away due to the development of newer encryption algorithms and concerns about the vulnerabilities 
		of the system. What will most likely be the next big innovation in cryptography - quantum cryptography, is being studied more and more as time goes on. It is possible that this form of 
		cryptography will finally succeed where most codes have failed: becoming unbreakable. As of 2020 that is not the case; but as shown time and time again in the past, the cryptological 
		possibilities brought on by new technology are endless.</p>
