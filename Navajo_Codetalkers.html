	<h3>the navajo codetalkers</h3>
	
	<p>Among all the ciphers used in World War II, there was one that accomplished something that not even the advanced codes of Germany and Japan 
		were able to. It remained unbreakable. It all started with a suggestion by an engineer named Phillip Johnston. He proposed using the language
		of the Navajo people to create a phonetic alphabet to use for communications. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up on a Navajo reservation. 
		At the time he was one of about thirty people in the world who could speak the language and were not part of the tribe. The language was spoken and
		had no written counterpart. More importantly no known Italian, German, or Japanese person had studied it. Twenty-nine Navajo, who would eventually 
		become the first codetalks, were recruited. With their help, a new code system began to take shape. At its heart, the system was a mixture of a 
		substitution cipher - albeit one where the codebooks were mental rather than physical - and a phonetic alphabet. Any number of words could be used 
		for the phonetic alphabet, as all that mattered was the first letter of the word's English translation. For frequently used military technology, they 
		assigned specific words to convey their meaning. An explanation provided about the code after material involving it was declassified is as follows:</p>
		
	<blockquote><em>“The code talker first had to translate each Navajo word into its English equivalent. Then he used only the first letter of the English 
		equivalent in spelling an English word...One way to say the word “Navy” in Navajo code would be “tsah (needle) wol-la-chee (ant) ah-keh-di- glini 
		(victor) tsah-ah-dzoh (yucca)”...The developers of the original code assigned Navajo words to represent about 450 frequently used military terms… “besh- lo” (iron fish) meant 
		“submarine”, “dah-he tih-hi” (hummingbird) meant “fighter plane” and “debeh-li-zine” (black street) meant “squad”.”</em></blockquote>

	<p>Upon finishing their training, the code talkers were dispatched into the field. Their first big test would be the Battle of Guadalcanal, where the 
		strengths of the code would quickly become apparent. Conventional cipher systems, although strong, were slow. To use them they required a message to 
		be written out, encrypted, the encrypted version written out and then transmitted to the receiver. There it would have to be taken to a matching 
		cipher machine and unencrypt it before it could be delivered to the commanding officer. Even with highly skilled operators, it could take several 
		hours to accomplish this.The use of the Navajo language as a verbal code cut out the tedious task of waiting for machines to do the work. Whoever 
		was sending the message did the encryption on the spot, which was matched by the instant decryption by the receiver. It could happen in a matter of 
		minutes, if not seconds. More impressive was the fact that they retained their accuracy despite the high speed. It was clear that the code talkers 
		were an invaluable asset on the battlefield. Soon all six Marine divisions had code talkers and they would go on to play critical roles in all major 
		battles. After the battle at Iwo Jima, the signal officer Major Howard Connor said “Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken 
		Iwo Jima.” His team of code talkers had successfully transmitted over eight hundred messages relaying vital battlefield information without making a 
		single mistake. </p>

		<p>At the end of the war, the Navajo codetalkers were forbidden from speaking about their unique contributions to the war effort. They would continue
			to serve until the Vietnam War. Unlike most other codes, it remained unbroken until it was finally declassified in 1968.</p>
