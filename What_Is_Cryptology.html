<h2>What is Cryptology?</h2>

<p>Cryptology, simply put, is the science of making and breaking encoded messages. It is derived from the Greek words <i>kryptos</i> and <i>logos</i>, which mean 
	"hidden" and "word" respectively. This field heavily relies on mathematics, algorithms, and computer sciences in order to create these messages, as well as decode
	them. Traditionally it is used in warfare to keep plans secret. In the modern era, however, it has spread into fields that require secure communication, such as e-commerce. 
	Cryptology itself is divided into two subfields: cryptography and cryptanalysis. A cryptographer works on creating the codes and ciphers used everyday, while cryptanalysts 
	work on decoding a cryptographer's work.</p>
